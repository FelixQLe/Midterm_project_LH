## Introduction

Predicting flights delay is always an interesting topic to Data Scientists. Since the issues of flights being late costs both airplane operations and consumer money and time, flight delay prediction plays a key role in aviation industry. There is much research have tried to develop and deploy different Machine Learning models to increase the accuracy of prediction.

In this one-week Midterm Project, we are supposed to perform a Data Science tasks which involving Preprocessing/Clean Data, Expletory Data Analysis (EDA), Model Selection, Feature Engineering, Feature Selection, Hyperparameter Tuning, and Prediction
